# Data Science for Policy

# Purpose
This repository has been built to answer the following question - "Has the increasing price of energy affect commutersâ€™ transport habits?".

# Structure
- data: here both raw and manipulated/cleaned data are stored
- shapefiles: here any shapefiles used for visualisations are saved
- useful_scripts: here are python scripts containing functions used elsewhere
- analysis: here is where the main scripts are saved, i.e. the ones gathering the data, manipulating them, then conducting analysis (i.e. visualisations)
- output: here is where both my final presentation as well as the visualisations are saved

# Notes
- In the config, you'll need to insert your own Nomis API key
